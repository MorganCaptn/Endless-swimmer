# Endless swimmer

[Endless swimmer title screen](./doc/EndlessSwimmer.PNG "Endless swimmer game screen")

This is my little endless running jump and run game designed for the cell phone. The game was created entirely in Unity 3D.

The player swims along a river and has to avoid the obstacles swimming towards him. To do this, he can move to the right and left or either jump over or dive under the obstacle. The combination of diving followed by a jump results in a particularly high super jump. This is necessary at higher levels to jump over certain obstacles.

There are also points to be scored. You simply have to hit these with the player. 

The game is still a work in progress. Game logic basically works, but there is still some fine-tuning to be done. Nicer graphics and a little music would also be very nice :)
